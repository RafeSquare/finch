# This base config, _all.yaml, applies to all stages in the same directory.
# It allows only the following 3 config sections:

# __ 01 _____________________________________________________________________
#
# MySQL usually applies to all stages because there's usually only 1 MySQL instance.
# But it could differ if, for example, a setup stage inserts rows on a writable
# source, and then benchmarks are run on a read-only replica.
mysql:
  dsn: "root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/sbtest"

# __ 02 _____________________________________________________________________
#
# Params usually apply to all stages to keep key settings in sync across stages
# and trx (SQL) files, like number of tables and rows. Each param is referenced
# like $params.rows or "${params.rows}". (YAML requires quotes around {}.)
params:
  rows: "1,000,000" # You can use human-readable numbers like this or "1M" 

# __ 03 _____________________________________________________________________
#
# Stats don't normally apply to all stages, but it's show here for demonstration.
# A stage can override this to turn off stats by setting stats.disable=true,
# as shown in setup.yaml.
stats:
  freq: 5s
