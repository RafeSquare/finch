Finch ships with example benchmarks in subdirectory `benchmarks/`.
As complete working examples that range from simple to complex, they're good study material for learning how to write Finch benchmarks and use Finch features.

{{< hint type=note title="Default Database" >}}
The Finch example benchmarks do not have a default database, and they do not drop schemas or tables.
Create a database to use&mdash;database `finch` is suggested.
Drop and recreate the database to reset and rerun a benchmark.

## aurora

Original 2015 Amazon Aurora benchmark
{.tagline}

|Stage|Type|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|setup.yaml|DDL|Create schema and insert rows|
|write-only.yaml|Standard|Execute read-write transaction|

A short benchmark with a [long and complicated history](https://hackmysql.com/post/are-aurora-performance-claims-true/).
The short version: Amazon used this benchmark in 2015 to established its "5X greater throughput than MySQL" claim.
Under the hood, it's the sysbench write-only benchmark with a specific workload: 4 EC2 (compute) instances each running 1,000 clients (all in the same availability zone), querying 250 tables each with 25,0000 rows.

Since this benchmark was designed to run on multiple compute instances, it's a little difficult to run locally unless you scale down the instances and clients:

```bash
finch -D finch -p instances=1 -p clients=8 benchmarks/aurora/write-only.yaml
```

## intro

[Intro / Start Here]({{< relref "intro/start-here" >}}) benchmarks
{.tagline}

|Stage|Type|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|setup.yaml|DDL|Create schema and insert rows|
|read-only.yaml|Standard|Execute single SELECT|
|row-lock.yaml|Standard|Execute SELECT and UPDATE transaction on 1,000 rows|

## sysbench

sysbench benchmarks recreated in Finch
{.tagline}

|Stage|Type|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|setup.yaml|DDL|Create schema and insert rows|
|read-only.yaml|Standard|sysbench OLTP read-only benchmark|
|write-only.yaml|Standard|sysbench OLTP write-only benchmark|

These recreate two of the legendary [sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) OLTP benchmarks: `oltp_read_only.lua` and `oltp_write_only.lua`.
They use one table name `sbtest1`.
Multiple tables are not supported, but the [aurora](#aurora) benchmark is the same benchmark on 250 tables.

## xfer

Na√Øve money transfer (xfer) with three tables and large data set
{.tagline}

|Stage|Type|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|setup.yaml|DDL|Create schema and insert rows|
|xfer.yaml|Standard|Execute read-write transaction|

The xfer benchmark is complex and demonstrates many of the advanced features of Finch.
